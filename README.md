## Installation

```bash
pip install stx-hardware-wallet
```

## Quick Start

```python
from stx_hardware_wallet import STXHardwareWallet, WalletConfig, HardwareWalletType
from stx_hardware_wallet import Transaction, TransactionType

async def main():
    # Initialize wallet configuration
    config = WalletConfig(
        device_type=HardwareWalletType.LEDGER,
        network="mainnet"
    )
    
    # Create wallet instance
    wallet = STXHardwareWallet(config)
    
    # Connect to device
    await wallet.connect_device()
    
    # Create a transfer transaction
    transaction = Transaction(
        type=TransactionType.TRANSFER,
        nonce=1,
        fee=180,
        sender="ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG",
        recipient="ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC",
        amount=1000000,
        memo="Transfer to hardware wallet"
    )
    
    # Sign transaction
    signed_tx = await wallet.sign_transaction(transaction)
    print(f"Signed transaction: {signed_tx}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced Usage

### Contract Interaction

```python
# Create contract call transaction
contract_tx = Transaction(
    type=TransactionType.CONTRACT_CALL,
    nonce=2,
    fee=250,
    sender="ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG",
    contract_name="my-contract",
    function_name="my-function",
    function_args=["arg1", "arg2"]
)

# Sign contract transaction
signed_contract_tx = await wallet.sign_transaction(contract_tx)
```

### Address Verification

```python
# Verify device address matches derived address
if await wallet.verify_address():
    print("‚úÖ Address verified successfully")
else:
    print("‚ùå Address verification failed")
```

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    await wallet.connect_device()
except DeviceConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
except HardwareWalletError as e:
    print(f"Hardware wallet error: {e}")
```

## Configuration Options

```python
config = WalletConfig(
    device_type=HardwareWalletType.LEDGER,  # or HardwareWalletType.TREZOR
    network="mainnet",                       # or "testnet"
    derivation_path="m/44'/5757'/0'/0/0",   # Custom derivation path
    device_timeout=30,                       # Connection timeout in seconds
    require_confirmation=True                # Require device confirmation
)
```
